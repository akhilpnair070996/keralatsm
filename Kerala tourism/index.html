                  <p>With an overwhelming presence of water in the form of canals and backwaters, the district of Alappuzha has a distinct lifestyle owing to the presence of these water bodies. The region has in store, some of the picturesque natural settings in Kerala. Interspersed with vast stretches of paddy fields, avenues of coconut trees, islets and villages, Alappuzha is also famous for coir making and coir-based industries. Historically, Alappuzha was once an important trading center and was popular among foreign traders as the ‘Venice of the East.’ Renowned for its any boat races, Alappuzha also has beautiful stretched fishing villages and is also one of the few places in the world, where farming is done below sea level.</p>

                    <p>Marari Beach is a beach in Alappuzha District of Kerala, India, 11 km from Alappuzha (Alleppey) town. Marari Beach is being increasingly preferred by travellers as an alternative to its more popular counterpart- Kovalam in the South. Tourists can cover the key highlights of Kerala including the Port town of Cochin, the tea plantations of Munnar, the wildlife in Periyar, the houseboats on the backwaters in Alleppey and end their stay at Marari where they can enjoy the beaches before flying out of Cochin again- instead of having to travel down south to Kovalam for the beaches. The beaches in Marari are conveniently located just an hour and a half away from the Cochin international airport.</p>

Invasions from across the sea was frequent and the invaders left indelible marks on the landscape, culture, art and social history of the place. Mattancherry welcomed every migrant community that came to her with warmth and provided them with ample opportunities to flourish. Thanks to the benevolence of the erstwhile kings of Cochin, many a community like that of Jews, Konkanis, Gujaratis, Jains and Marathis made the place their home. Even today, Mattancherry has people of different tongues and ethnic identities. Churches, agraharams, mosques and a synagogue co-exist in the area, along with the buildings of the colonial era, pointing to a vibrant past and a harmonious present.</p>

                    <hr class="line-heading">
                    <p>Willington Island was created by the visionary harbour engineer, Sir Robert Bristow, who foresaw the possibility of creating a man-made island while deepening the Kochi harbour. In 1928, during the modernization of the harbour under Bristow’s supervision, the mud and materials dredged out was used to create an island. Today, after about 82 years, the island, standing in an area of around 775 acres amidst the backwaters, is one of the bustling trade centres of  the country. The island, named after Lord Willington, the then Viceroy of India, is connected to the mainland of Ernakulam through the Venduruthy Bridge. The presence of the Mattancherry and Ernakulam wharfs on either sides was an important contributing factor in its growth as an important trading centre in Kochi.  At present, the island houses the modern port, many important offices, hotels and buildings including that of the Southern Naval Command and the Cochin Port Trust. </p>

The peculiarity of the Silent Valley Forest is that it is even devoid of the chirping of cicadas’. Vehicular transport is possible only up to Mukkali, nearly 24 km from the park. The rest of the way has to be covered by foot, up to the source of Kunthipuzha, which flows through the valley before merging into the Bharathapuzha River. The closest to a virgin forest in the entire Western Ghats, the Silent Valley National Park is home to India’s last substantial stretch of tropical evergreen forests. It’s difficult terrain and remoteness shelters a large number of wild animals.</p>
